🤖 What is Supervised Learning (SL)?
Supervised Learning is a type of Machine Learning where a model learns from a labeled dataset — meaning each input has a known, correct output (called a label).

📚 Think of it like using flashcards to teach a child:

You show a picture and say “This is a cat.” The child learns to associate the image with the correct word.

🛠️ How to Use Supervised Learning?
1️⃣ Collect Labeled Data
~ Real-world examples with inputs and correct outputs
  📸 Example: Images of animals labeled as Cat, Dog, Rabbit

2️⃣ Split the Dataset
~ Divide into:
  📊 Training Set (e.g., 80%)
  🧪 Test Set (e.g., 20%)

3️⃣ Choose an Algorithm
~ Based on your task:
  📦 Classification → Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest
  📈 Regression → Linear Regression, SVR

4️⃣ Train the Model
~ Feed the labeled data so it can learn the patterns

5️⃣ Test the Model
~ Evaluate its performance using the test set

6️⃣ Evaluate Performance
~ Use metrics like:
  ✅ Accuracy (for classification)
  📉 Mean Squared Error (MSE) (for regression)
  🧮 F1-score (for imbalanced data)

❓ Why Do We Use Supervised Learning?
📊 Predict Outcomes
~ Stock prices, weather forecasts, exam scores

📋 Classify Things
~ Spam detection, image recognition, medical diagnosis

⚙️ Automate Tasks
~ Automates complex decisions that usually require humans

🎯 High Accuracy
~ Very effective when trained with large and clean labeled data
