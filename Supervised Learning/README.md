🤖 What is Supervised Learning (SL)?
Supervised Learning is a type of Machine Learning where a model learns from a labeled dataset — meaning each input has a known, correct output (called a label).

📚 Think of it like using flashcards to teach a child:
You show a picture and say “This is a cat.” The child learns to associate the image with the correct word.


🛠️ How to Use Supervised Learning ?
1️⃣ Collect Labeled Data
~ Real-world examples with inputs and correct outputs
  📸 Example: Images of animals labeled as Cat, Dog, Rabbit

2️⃣ Split the Dataset
~ Divide into:
  📊 Training Set (e.g., 80%)
  🧪 Test Set (e.g., 20%)

3️⃣ Choose an Algorithm
~ Based on your task:
📦 Classification → Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest
📈 Regression → Linear Regression, SVR

4️⃣ Train the Model
~ Feed labeled data so it can learn patterns

5️⃣ Test the Model
~ Evaluate performance using unseen data (test set)

6️⃣ Evaluate Performance
~ Use metrics like:
✅ Accuracy (for classification)
📉 Mean Squared Error (for regression)
🧮 F1-score (for imbalanced classes)


❓ Why Do We Use Supervised Learning?
📊 Predict Outcomes
~ Stock prices, weather, exam scores

📋 Classify Things
~ Email spam detection, image classification, disease diagnosis

⚙️ Automate Tasks
~ Automates decisions that would require human effort

🎯 High Accuracy
~ Works very well when labeled data is high-quality and large enough
