# 🤖 What is Supervised Learning (SL)?

**Supervised Learning** is a type of **Machine Learning** where a model learns from a **labeled dataset** — meaning each input has a known, correct output (called a **label**).

📚 Think of it like using flashcards to teach a child:  
You show a picture and say “This is a cat.” The child learns to associate the image with the correct word.

## 🛠️ **How to Use Supervised Learning?**

1. **Collect Labeled Data**  
   ~ Real-world examples with inputs and correct outputs  
   📸 *Example:* Images of animals labeled as **Cat**, **Dog**, **Rabbit**

2. **Split the Dataset**  
   ~ Divide into:  
   📊 **Training Set** (e.g., 80%)  
   🧪 **Test Set** (e.g., 20%)

3. **Choose an Algorithm**  
   ~ Based on your task:  
   📦 *Classification* → Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest  
   📈 *Regression* → Linear Regression, SVR

4. **Train the Model**  
   ~ Feed the labeled data so it can learn the patterns

5. **Test the Model**  
   ~ Evaluate its performance using the test set

6. **Evaluate Performance**  
   ~ Use metrics like:  
   ✅ **Accuracy** (for classification)  
   📉 **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** (for regression)  
   🧮 **F1-score** (for imbalanced data)

## ❓ **Why Do We Use Supervised Learning?**

1. 📊 **Predict Outcomes**  
   ~ Stock prices, weather forecasts, exam scores

2. 📋 **Classify Things**  
   ~ Spam detection, image recognition, medical diagnosis

3. ⚙️ **Automate Tasks**  
   ~ Automates complex decisions that usually require humans

4. 🎯 **High Accuracy**  
   ~ Very effective when trained with large and clean labeled data
