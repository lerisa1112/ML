# 📈 What is Linear Regression in Machine Learning?

**Linear Regression** is a type of **Supervised Learning** algorithm used to **predict continuous values** (numerical outputs) based on one or more input features.

📚 Think of it like predicting a student’s marks based on the number of study hours.

## 🛠️ How to Use Linear Regression?

1. **Collect Data**  
   Gather real-world data containing input and output values.  
   📊 Example:  
   - Input: Hours studied  
   - Output: Marks scored

2. **Preprocess the Data**  
   Clean and prepare the dataset for training.  
   🧽 Example: Handle missing values, scale features, and remove outliers.

3. **Split the Dataset**  
   Divide into:  
   - 📘 **Training Set** (e.g., 80%)  
   - 🧪 **Test Set** (e.g., 20%)

4. **Choose a Regression Algorithm**  
   Types of Regression:
   - Simple Linear Regression (1 variable)
   - Multiple Linear Regression (many variables)
   - Polynomial Regression
   - Ridge / Lasso Regression

5. **Train the Model**  
   Fit the model to the training data to learn the relationship between input and output.

6. **Test the Model**  
   Predict outcomes for new or unseen data using the trained model.

7. **Evaluate the Performance**  
   Metrics:
   - 📉 Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
   - 🧮 Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)  
   - 📊 R² Score (Coefficient of Determination)

## ❓ Why Do We Use Linear Regression?

- 📈 **To Predict Continuous Outcomes**  
  e.g., Predict house prices, salary, sales, or temperature.

- 🧠 **To Understand Relationships**  
  Helps identify how changes in one variable affect another.

- 🎯 **To Forecast Future Trends**  
  e.g., Business growth or demand prediction.

## ⚙️ How Linear Regression Works

It fits a **straight line** (called a regression line) through the data that best represents the relationship between variables.

**Equation:**

\[
Y = a + bX
\]

Where:  
- **Y** = Dependent Variable (what we predict)  
- **X** = Independent Variable (input feature)  
- **a** = Intercept  
- **b** = Slope of the line
