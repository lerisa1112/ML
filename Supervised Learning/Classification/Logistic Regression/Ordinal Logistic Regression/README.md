# üî¢ Ordinal Logistic Regression

**Ordinal Logistic Regression** (also known as the **proportional odds model**) is a supervised learning algorithm used for **ordinal classification** tasks.  
In ordinal classification, the target variable has **ordered categories** (e.g., Low, Medium, High), but the distances between them are **not explicitly known**.

Ordinal logistic regression estimates the probability that a response falls **at or below** a certain category.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use Ordinal Logistic Regression

1. **Collect Ordinal Data**  
   - Target variable should consist of **ordered categories** (e.g., 0 < 1 < 2)

2. **Preprocess the Data**  
   - Encode categorical features  
   - Ensure the target is ordinally encoded (not one-hot)  
   - Normalize or scale features if necessary

3. **Choose a Suitable Library**  
   - Use `mord`, `statsmodels`, or custom implementation  
   - Example with `mord`:

   ```python
   from mord import LogisticIT  # LogisticIT = Logistic - Increasing Thresholds

   model = LogisticIT()
   model.fit(X_train, y_train)
   predictions = model.predict(X_test)
   ```

4. **Evaluate the Model**  
   - Accuracy  
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
   - Cohen's Kappa  
   - Confusion matrix

## ‚ùì Why Do We Use Ordinal Logistic Regression?

- ‚úÖ Handles **ordered target variables** naturally
- üîç Maintains **ranking information** in the output
- üßÆ Provides **cumulative probability estimates**
- üì¶ Useful for problems like satisfaction rating, education level, income brackets, etc.
- üõ†Ô∏è Better than treating ordinal data as nominal or numeric

## üß† How Ordinal Logistic Regression Works

1. **Cumulative Probability Modeling**  
   - For each threshold `j`, model the probability that `Y ‚â§ j`

2. **Use Logistic Function to Estimate Odds**  
   - The model estimates log-odds of being below or equal to a class threshold

3. **Proportional Odds Assumption**  
   - Assumes that the effect of predictors is the same across thresholds

4. **Prediction**  
   - The predicted class is where the cumulative probability exceeds a threshold
