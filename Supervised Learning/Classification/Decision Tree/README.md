## 🤖 What is a Decision Tree?

A **Decision Tree** is a **supervised machine learning algorithm** used for both **classification** and **regression** tasks.  
It works like a flowchart: each internal node represents a test on a feature, each branch represents the result of the test, and each leaf node represents an outcome (label or value).

📦 *Example*:  
If you're trying to decide whether to play outside:
- Is it sunny?
  - Yes → Is it hot?
    - Yes → Stay inside  
    - No → Go play  
  - No → Stay inside

## 🛠️ How to Use a Decision Tree

1. **Collect Labeled Data**  
   ~ Your dataset should include input features and known outputs.

2. **Preprocess the Data**  
   ~ Handle missing values, convert categories to numbers if needed.

3. **Train the Model**  
   ~ Use a library like `scikit-learn` to fit a `DecisionTreeClassifier`.

4. **Make Predictions**  
   ~ Use the trained tree to predict labels for new data.

5. **Evaluate the Model**  
   ~ Use metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and Confusion Matrix.

6. **Visualize (Optional)**  
   ~ You can plot the decision tree to see how it splits data.

## ❓ Why Do We Use a Decision Tree?

- ✅ **Easy to understand and interpret**  
- ⚙️ **No need for data scaling or normalization**  
- 🔄 **Handles both categorical and numerical data**  
- 🪓 **Works well with non-linear relationships**  
- 🧹 **Performs feature selection automatically during splitting**  
- 🧠 **Great base model for ensemble methods like Random Forest or XGBoost**

## ⚙️ How Does a Decision Tree Work?

1. **Start at the Root Node**  
   Use all training data and choose the best feature to split based on:
   - Gini Impurity  
   - Entropy (Information Gain)

2. **Recursive Splitting**  
   Each internal node tests a feature to split the data into child nodes.

3. **Stopping Condition**  
   - All data belongs to a single class  
   - Max depth is reached  
   - Minimum number of samples per node is met

4. **Prediction**  
   For any new input, follow the tree branches based on its features to reach a prediction at the leaf node.
