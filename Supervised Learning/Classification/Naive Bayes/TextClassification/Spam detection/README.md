# 📧 What is Spam Detection?

**Spam Detection** is a classification technique in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** that helps identify **unsolicited or harmful messages** such as ads, scams, and phishing attacks — usually in **emails or text messages**.

📚 Think of it like a **digital filter**:  
Just like you throw away junk mail in real life, spam detection filters out unwanted digital messages.

## 🛠️ How to Use Spam Detection?

1. **Collect Labeled Message Data**  
   ~ Each message must be labeled as **Spam** or **Ham** (Not Spam)  
   📄 Example: SMS messages like "You’ve won a prize!" → **Spam**

2. **Preprocess the Text**  
   ~ Clean the text and convert it to a format machines understand  
   🧹 Remove stopwords, lowercase the text, apply **Bag of Words** or **TF-IDF**

3. **Split the Dataset**  
   ~ Divide into:  
   📊 **Training Set** (e.g., 80%)  
   🧪 **Test Set** (e.g., 20%)

4. **Train a Classifier**  
   ~ Often a **Naive Bayes** model is used due to its performance with text

5. **Make Predictions**  
   ~ Classify new incoming messages as **Spam** or **Not Spam**

6. **Evaluate Accuracy**  
   ~ Use metrics like:  
   ✅ **Accuracy**  
   ⚖️ **Precision & Recall**  
   🧮 **Confusion Matrix**
