## 💬 What is News Categorization?

**News Categorization** is a technique in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** that classifies news articles or headlines into predefined categories such as **Politics**, **Sports**, **Technology**, etc.

📚 Think of it like a **topic sorter**:  
Just as a librarian sorts books into genres, this technique automatically assigns a news piece to its appropriate category.

## 🛠️ How to Use News Categorization?

1. **Collect News Data**  
   ~ Headlines or full articles from news websites, RSS feeds, or user input  
   📰 Example: `"New budget announced by the government"` → Category: **Politics**

2. **Preprocess the Text**  
   ~ Clean the text for model input  
   🧹 Lowercase, remove punctuation, stopwords, tokenize

3. **Vectorize the Text**  
   ~ Convert text into numerical features using **Bag of Words** or **TF-IDF**

4. **Train a Classifier**  
   ~ Use **Naive Bayes**, **SVM**, or **Neural Networks** to learn from labeled data  
   🎯 Model learns patterns and associations with categories

5. **Predict and Classify**  
   ~ Feed new headlines to the model to predict their category  
   ✨ Example: `"Elon Musk unveils new AI robot"` → **Tech**

6. **Use or Visualize Results**  
   ~ Show categorized news on websites, dashboards, or feed filters
