# 💬 What is Sentiment Analysis?

**Sentiment Analysis** is a technique in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** that identifies the **emotional tone** behind a body of text — whether it's **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral**.

📚 Think of it like a **mood detector**:  
Just like you sense the tone in someone's voice, sentiment analysis detects the tone in written language.

## 🛠️ How to Use Sentiment Analysis?

1. **Collect Text Data**  
   ~ This can be reviews, comments, tweets, or messages  
   📄 Example: "I love this product!" → Sentiment: **Positive**

2. **Preprocess the Text**  
   ~ Clean and normalize the text (lowercase, remove punctuation, etc.)  
   🧹 Tokenization, Stopword removal, Lemmatization (optional)

3. **Apply Sentiment Scoring**  
   ~ Use pre-trained tools like **TextBlob** or **VADER**  
   📊 They assign a score to the text based on emotional polarity

4. **Classify the Sentiment**  
   ~ Based on the score:  
   😄 **Positive** if score > 0  
   😐 **Neutral** if score = 0  
   😠 **Negative** if score < 0

5. **Visualize or Use the Result**  
   ~ Show results in UI, chatbot, dashboard, etc.
