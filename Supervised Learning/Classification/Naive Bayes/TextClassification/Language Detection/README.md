## ü§ñ What is Language Detection?

**Language Detection** is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) task that determines the **language** a piece of text is written in (e.g., English, French, Hindi, etc.).

It is a **classification problem**, where each input text is classified into one of several predefined languages.

## üõ†Ô∏è **How to Use Language Detection**

1. **Collect Text Samples**
   ~ Create a dataset with labeled sentences in different languages.

2. **Preprocess Text**
   ~ Convert text into numerical format using tokenization, bag-of-words, or TF-IDF.

3. **Choose Classifier**
   ~ We use **Multinomial Naive Bayes**, suitable for discrete word counts.

4. **Train the Model**
   ~ Use labeled data to teach the model to associate patterns with languages.

5. **Evaluate the Model**
   ~ Check prediction performance using accuracy or F1-score.

6. **Predict Language**
   ~ Give a new sentence to the model and it predicts the language.

## ‚ùì Why Do We Use Language Detection?

1. **Auto-detect input language** for search engines, chatbots, translators.  
2. **Filter or route messages** in multilingual applications.  
3. **Preprocess text** in NLP pipelines (e.g., translate before sentiment analysis).  
4. **Enhance User Experience** in global applications by auto-switching UI language.  
5. **Spam or fraud detection** based on unexpected language use.
