# 🤖 What is Classification in Machine Learning?

**Classification** is a type of **Supervised Learning** where the model learns to **predict categories (labels)** from input data.

📚 Think of it like sorting emails:  
You read the content and decide whether it’s **Spam** or **Not Spam**.

## 🛠️ How to Use Classification?

1. **Collect Labeled Data**  
   Real-world data with inputs and known class labels  
   📸 Example: Emails labeled as **Spam** or **Not Spam**

2. **Preprocess the Data**  
   Clean, encode, scale, and prepare the features  
   🧽 Example: Handle missing values, normalize features, label encode categories

3. **Split the Dataset**  
   Divide into:  
   - 📊 **Training Set** (e.g., 80%)  
   - 🧪 **Test Set** (e.g., 20%)

4. **Choose a Classification Algorithm**  
   Depends on the task:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Decision Tree
   - Naive Bayes
   - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
   - Random Forest
   - Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM)

5. **Train the Model**  
   Fit the model to the training data

6. **Test the Model**  
   Use the model to predict on the test data

7. **Evaluate the Performance**  
   Metrics:
   - ✅ Accuracy
   - 📉 Precision & Recall
   - 🧮 F1-Score
   - 📊 Confusion Matrix

## ❓ Why Do We Use Classification?

- 📊 **To Predict Discrete Outcomes**  
  e.g., Will it rain tomorrow? Yes or No

- 🧠 **To Automate Decisions**  
  e.g., Email filters, fraud detection, diagnostics

- 🎯 **To Learn Patterns From Historical Data**  
  e.g., Customer churn, product recommendations
