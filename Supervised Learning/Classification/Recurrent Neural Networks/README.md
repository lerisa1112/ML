# 🤖 What is Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)?

**Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** are a type of **artificial neural network** designed to recognize patterns in sequences of data, such as **time series**, **text**, **speech**, or **video**.

📚 Think of it like having a memory:  
RNNs remember **previous information** and use it to influence the **current output** — making them ideal for tasks where **context** matters.

## 🛠️ How to Use Recurrent Neural Networks?

1. **Collect Sequential Data**  
   ~ Data where the order matters.  
   📸 Example: Sentences in natural language, stock price over time, weather records.

2. **Preprocess the Data**  
   ~ Clean, normalize, and transform it into a suitable format.  
   📦 Example: Tokenize sentences, scale time series values.

3. **Choose an RNN Architecture**  
   ~ Options include:  
     🔹 **Vanilla RNN** – Basic recurrent model  
     🔹 **LSTM** (Long Short-Term Memory) – Handles long dependencies better  
     🔹 **GRU** (Gated Recurrent Unit) – Simplified LSTM with similar performance

4. **Train the Model**  
   ~ Feed sequences into the RNN so it can learn dependencies.  
   🧠 Use **Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)** for learning.

5. **Evaluate the Model**  
   ~ Measure performance using metrics like **accuracy** (for classification) or **RMSE** (for regression).

6. **Deploy the Model**  
   ~ Use the trained RNN to make predictions on new sequential data.

## ❓ Why Do We Use Recurrent Neural Networks?

1. 📜 **Sequence Prediction**  
   ~ Predict next words in a sentence, next stock price, or next frame in a video.

2. 🗣 **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**  
   ~ Chatbots, translation, sentiment analysis.

3. 🎵 **Speech & Audio Processing**  
   ~ Voice recognition, music generation.

4. 📈 **Time Series Analysis**  
   ~ Forecasting trends in finance, weather, or sensor data.

5. 🧠 **Context Awareness**  
   ~ RNNs retain previous state information to improve predictions.

## ⚙️ How Does a Recurrent Neural Network Work?

RNNs process **one element of a sequence at a time**, while maintaining a **hidden state** that carries forward information from previous steps.

**Key points:**
- At each step, the RNN takes the **current input** and the **previous hidden state** to produce the **current output**.
- This hidden state acts like a **memory** of previous inputs.
- Training uses **Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)** to adjust weights.

**Basic Workflow:**
1. Input sequence enters the network one time step at a time.
2. Hidden state updates after each step.
3. Output generated at each step or after the final step.
4. Model learns patterns across time.
