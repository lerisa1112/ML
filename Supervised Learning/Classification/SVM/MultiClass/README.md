## ü§ñ What is Multiclass Support Vector Machine (M-SVM)?

**Support Vector Machine (SVM)** is a powerful **supervised machine learning algorithm** used for **classification** and **regression** problems.  
It works by finding the optimal hyperplane that best separates data into different classes.

SVM aims to maximize the **margin** between data points of different classes to make better generalizations on unseen data.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use Multiclass SVM

1. **Collect Data**  
   Gather labeled training data for more than two classes (e.g., classify images into cat, dog, horse).

2. **Preprocess Data**  
   - Normalize or scale features  
   - Convert categorical data to numerical  
   - Handle missing values

3. **Choose Kernel Type**  
   - **Linear**  
   - **Polynomial**  
   - **RBF (Radial Basis Function)**  
   - **Sigmoid**

4. **Select Multiclass Strategy**  
   - **One-vs-One (OvO)**: Train one SVM per pair of classes.  
   - **One-vs-Rest (OvR)**: Train one SVM per class vs all others.

5. **Train the SVM Model**  
   Fit the model on the training dataset using the chosen kernel & strategy.

6. **Tune Hyperparameters**  
   Adjust `C`, `gamma`, `degree`, and `kernel` for best results.

7. **Test and Evaluate**  
   Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.

8. **Make Predictions**  
   Classify new, unseen data.

## ‚ùì Why Do We Use Multiclass SVM?

1. **Handles Multiple Categories**  
   Extends SVM from binary classification to multi-class problems.

2. **High Accuracy in Complex Spaces**  
   Works well in high-dimensional feature spaces.

3. **Robust with Clear Margins**  
   Maximizes separation between classes.

4. **Works with Non-linear Data**  
   Uses kernel trick for complex, non-linear decision boundaries.

5. **Versatile**  
   Applicable to text classification, image recognition, bioinformatics, etc.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How Does Multiclass SVM Work?

1. **Binary SVM Foundation**  
   Multiclass SVM builds on binary SVM by combining multiple binary classifiers.

2. **One-vs-One (OvO) Strategy**  
   - For *n* classes, trains `n(n-1)/2` classifiers.  
   - Each classifier distinguishes between two classes.

3. **One-vs-Rest (OvR) Strategy**  
   - Trains *n* classifiers.  
   - Each classifier distinguishes one class from all others.

4. **Prediction**  
   - OvO: Voting system decides the final label.  
   - OvR: Class with the highest decision score is chosen.

5. **Kernel Trick**  
   Projects data to higher dimensions for linear separation.

6. **Slack Variable (Soft Margin)**  
   Allows some misclassifications to improve generalization.
