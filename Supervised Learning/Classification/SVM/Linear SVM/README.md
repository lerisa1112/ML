## 🔶 What is Linear SVM?

**Linear SVM (Support Vector Machine)** is a supervised learning algorithm used for **binary classification** tasks where the data is **linearly separable**. It finds the optimal hyperplane that **maximally separates** the two classes.

📌 A **linear hyperplane** is a straight line (in 2D), plane (in 3D), or hyperplane (in higher dimensions) that splits the dataset.

## 🛠️ How to Use Linear SVM

1. **Import the Classifier**
   ```python
   from sklearn.svm import SVC
   ```

2. **Initialize Linear SVM**
   ```python
   model = SVC(kernel='linear', C=1.0)
   ```

3. **Train the Model**
   ```python
   model.fit(X_train, y_train)
   ```

4. **Make Predictions**
   ```python
   y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
   ```

5. **Evaluate the Model**
   ```python
   accuracy = model.score(X_test, y_test)
   print("Accuracy:", accuracy)
   ```

## ❓ Why Do We Use Linear SVM?

1. ✅ **Fast and Efficient for Linearly Separable Data**  
   ~ Ideal for problems where a linear decision boundary is sufficient

2. 🧠 **Highly Interpretable**  
   ~ Easy to visualize and understand in low dimensions

3. 📈 **Robust and Effective**  
   ~ Even in high-dimensional spaces

4. 🧪 **Strong Generalization Performance**  
   ~ Avoids overfitting with the right margin and regularization

## ⚙️ How Does Linear SVM Work?

### 📐 Mathematical Intuition:
Linear SVM solves the following optimization problem:

```
Minimize: (1/2)||w||²  
Subject to: yᵢ(w·xᵢ + b) ≥ 1
```

- `w`: weight vector (defines orientation of hyperplane)  
- `b`: bias (defines offset from origin)  
- `yᵢ`: class label (+1 or -1)  
- `xᵢ`: input feature vector

### 🧠 Mechanism:

1. **Finds the optimal hyperplane** separating the classes with **maximum margin**
2. Only **support vectors** (critical data points) influence the decision boundary
3. Linear kernel means the decision function is a **linear combination** of the input features
