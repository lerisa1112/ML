# ü§ñ What is Machine Learning (ML)?
Machine Learning is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that gives computers the ability to learn from data and make decisions without being explicitly programmed for every task.


üõ†Ô∏è How to Use ML?
1. Collect Data
~  Real-world examples (images, text, numbers, audio, etc.)

2. Preprocess Data
~  Clean and structure the data (e.g., remove noise, convert text to numbers)

3. Choose a Model
~  Pick an algorithm (e.g., decision tree, neural network)

4. Train the Model
~  Feed data so the model learns patterns

5. Evaluate Performance
~  Test how well it predicts using metrics like accuracy or error rate

6. Make Predictions
~  Apply the model to new data

7. Improve Continuously
~  Update model with new data (learning never stops)


‚ùì Why Do We Use ML?
1. Learns Automatically :- 	No need to write separate logic for every new rule.
2. Adapts Over Time	:- Becomes smarter with more data (self-improving).
3. Finds Hidden Patterns	:- Detects relationships that humans often miss (e.g., in medical or stock data).
4. Scales Easily	:- Works on millions of inputs (e.g., facial recognition for billions of images).
5. Reduces Human Bias	:- If trained properly, it can make decisions purely based on data.
6. Real-Time Decision Making	:- Useful in fraud detection, autonomous cars, etc.
7. Cost Saving Automation	:- Saves time and effort in repetitive or complex tasks.
8. Personalization	:- Used in Netflix, YouTube, Amazon to personalize recommendations.
9. Works with Unstructured Data	:- Can analyze text, speech, images, and video data.
